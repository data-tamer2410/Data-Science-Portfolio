# Data Science Portfolio
Here you will find my data science projects.

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! Here you can find my projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Projects

### 3. [Accelerometer Activity Classification](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-accelerometer-activity-classification)
**Technologies used**:
* **SciKit-Learn**;
* **Optuna**;
*  **Pandas**;
*  **Numpy**;
*  **Matplotlib**;
*  **Seaborn**.

In this project, I developed a human activity recognition system that accurately classifies activities such as idle, running, walking, and climbing stairs using accelerometer data. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, including k-NN and Random Forest, I implemented a pipeline for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation. The project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced analytics to real-world problems and highlights my skills in data science, machine learning, and software development. The high accuracy achieved not only showcases the effectiveness of the models used but also emphasizes the potential for real-time applications in health monitoring and smart device integration.

**Technologies used**:
* **SciKit-Learn**;
* **Optuna**;
*  **Pandas**;
*  **Numpy**;
*  **Matplotlib**;
*  **Seaborn**.

This project evaluated different machine learning models for predicting real estate prices.

### 5. [Developer Salary Analysis](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-developer-salary-analysis/tree/main)
**Technologies used**:
*  **Pandas**;
*  **Numpy**;
*  **Matplotlib**;
*  **Seaborn**.

This project involves analyzing developer salaries based on data from a June 2017 developer survey.

### 6. [Analysis of Birth Rates in Ukrainian Regions](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-analysis-of-birth-rates-in-ukrainian-regions)
**Technologies used**:
*  **Pandas**;
*  **Numpy**;
*  **Matplotlib**;
*  **Seaborn**.

This project explores fertility rate trends in Ukraine from 1950 to 2019 across different regions. Using data extracted from Wikipedia, we analyze how the birth rates have changed over time and provide visual insights into the factors influencing these trends.

### 7. [Manipulation with SQLite](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-manipulation-with-sqlite/tree/master)
**Technologies used**:
*  **SQLite**;
*  **SQL**.

In this project, I demonstrated my knowledge of the SQL programming language and my ability to work with SQLite in Python.

---

### 8. [Manipulation with MongoDB](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-manipulation-with-mongodb/tree/master)
**Technologies used**:
*  **MongoDB**;
*  **BeautifulSoup**;
*  **Requests**;
*  **JSON**.

This repository showcases my MongoDB skills using pymongo, and scraping and parsing skills using beautifulsoup4 and requests.

---

### 9. [Console Bot Helper](https://github.com/data-tamer2410/ds-console-bot-helper/tree/master)
**Technologies used**:
*  **Docker**;
*  **DateTime**.

This is a console bot assistant, it is not related to data science, with this project I want to show the ability to work with Docker.
